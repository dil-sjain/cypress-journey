## Usage

- Place your test specifications in the `cypress/integration` directory.
- Use the `cypress/fixtures` directory to store any mock data needed for your tests.
- Customize Cypress behavior by adding plugins in the `cypress/plugins/index.js` file.
- Define reusable commands in `cypress/support/commands.js`.
